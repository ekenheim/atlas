# Implementation log

Per `START_HERE.md`: after each ticket or phase, record the files, the acceptance tests run and their **actual** results, open blockers, credential dependencies, version decisions and the next task. Say plainly when something was only tested against fixtures.

## 2026-09-28: ticket 01, walking skeleton

- **Built:**
  - uv project (Python 3.12.10, `uv.lock`)
  - `atlas` package: FastAPI app factory, settings, health, JSON logging, CLI `api | worker [--once] | migrate`, Alembic baseline revision `0001`
  - Next.js 16.3 static export (TypeScript 6.0 strict, ESLint 9)
  - multi-stage Dockerfile (non-root uid 10001, read-only-root compatible)
  - Compose: `postgres-app` (Postgres 17), `silo` (PGSTY Silo, pinned digest), `migrate`, `api`, `worker`
  - `scripts/ci.sh`, `scripts/image-smoke.sh`, `.github/workflows/ci.yml`
  - `.env.example`, README, AGENTS.md
- **Tests (TDD at the agreed seams):** 11 passing:
  - liveness
  - readiness: ok, database down, archive down (all fail closed with 503)
  - metrics
  - static frontend mount
  - CLI: missing required settings fail fast, `worker --once` with disabled-provider notices
  - settings: CRLF `.env` and CR-in-env stripping
  - migrations from an empty database

  A mutation check confirmed the fail-closed tests go red when readiness always reports ready.
- **CI entrypoint:** `scripts/ci.sh` passed locally end to end (≈3.5 min). **GitHub Actions passed** on the first push (run 36480960995, commit `1413ee8`, 2026-09-28, ≈1.5 min, including the image build + smoke).
- **Manual check:** `docker compose up -d --build --wait api`, then `/health/ready` reported database and archive `ok` and Hindsight/LiteLLM `not_configured`; `/` served the frontend; `/metrics` exposed `atlas_build_info`; logs are JSON.
- **Deviations and notes:**
  - The dev dependency is `httpx2`, because Starlette deprecates `httpx` for its test client.
  - The API host port defaults to 58080 (8000 was taken locally), configurable via `ATLAS_API_PORT`.
  - The Compose worker runs `--once` until the job queue exists (ticket 04).
  - The S3 archive backend is not wired into readiness yet; that's ticket 05.
- **Credentials:** none needed.
- **Next:** tickets 03 (audit trail), 04 (job queue), 05 (archive), 06 (EDGAR adapter), 11 (Hindsight gateway) and 18 (release pipeline) are unblocked. Ticket 02 (docs pack) and 20 (home-ops prerequisites) were unblocked already.
